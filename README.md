# [Preliminary Research Inquiry](https://humandynamics.github.io/evident/)

*What are the key issues, options, and opportunities for using crowdsourced tools to collect evidence of war crimes and human rights abuses in the Ukraine war?*

## Initial Questions

* What are the key functional and legal requirements and desired capabilities for crowd-sourced gathering of war crimes evidence? (eg authentication of source and evidentiary artifacts, what will be needed later in a tribunal for admissibility and persuasive power of such evidence, what metadata is needed to usefully manage the corpus of evidence as part of a large e-discovery or litigation management corpus, how is chain of custody adequately assured and what is adequate assurance in this context)?
* What other investigation or historical affordances can such evidence provide outside of a war crimes tribunal, etc)?
* What are the risks and threats to the operatiion and use of an app, platform, service or other system for crowd-sourced evidence gathering and storage and use of data? 
* What user interface and user experience would be most helpful and usable for individuals to operate the input methods for providing such evidence?
* How can the privacy and security of individual users be protected?
